## Prophetic Outreach Chapel Cleveland

### Evangelitic Jurisdiction
Apostle C. Tyehimba Thonor-Kuykendall, II, D.D. is the Jurisdictional Overseer. He is the Abbott/Presiding Prelate/Chief-Apostle of this Faith-Community.

Bishop C. Tyehimba Thonor-Kuykendall, II, D.D. is the Overseer of the Evangelistic Jurisdiction. Evangelistic Jurisdiction is where the Spirit of the Living God is free to dwell in and among us to use us according to his purpose!

This is the Jurisdiction in which:
1. The Mother Chapel (Headquarters) resides.
2. Prophetic Outreach Chapel/Cleveland (POCC)-LRMG resides.

### Our Chapel
The chapel is a place where ALL are welcome! In 2012 the Lord called for the formation and operation of this chapel. If you like the smaller chapel where everybody knows your name, where you are missed when you are not there, a place, a place where you feel love, where YOU matter! Most importantly this a place where the presents of the Lord is here. Where miracles, healing, and The Word of God is preached.

This is a place where we welcome the Holy Spirit taking control of the services. Where the primary goal is winning souls for Jesus the Christ, and working with the saints to meet the condition to receive the gift of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, with evidence of speaking-in-tongues.

We are a diverse and multi-cultural congregation, that come together with the freedom to praise the Lord. The freedom to tell of his goodness, sing our songs of praise in the Testimony Services. We obey Psalms 150.

### Our History
This ministry was started as an "Outreach Ministry" in 2007 by Abbott/Presiding-Prelate/Chief-Apostle C. Tyehimba Thonor-Kuykendall, II, D.D. He was lead to go out to the streets and pass out tracks & Our Daily Bread. Althouth the targeted area was E116th an Buckeye, he went up and down buckeye passing out tracks, praying for those that needed prayer, and counseling those that need this as well. All of this was accomplished by leading of the Holy Spirit.

The Out-Reach minister served those that didn't have a pastor or a church home. Hospital visits to pray for those requesting prayer. Home visits to check on those that were home-bound. Nursing home visits for thise that reside there. Also included pre-wedding counseling, alone with the matrimony service.

In 2013, the Lord called Abbott Thonor-Kuykendall to start pastoring inside a santuary as well as outside as an "Outreach Ministry." He gave us the name "Prophetic Outreach Chapel", and as a chapel of the Life Ripples Ministries Global; the -LRMG is added

In 2014, the Lord seeded a branch in Pakistan. The name of that ministry is called "Prophetic Chapel Pakistan-LRMG". Please keep this chapel in your prayers as many are experiencing a pentecostal worship service for the first time. Please pray for the ministry staff there that is being trained as well. As the Pakistan Jurisdiction expands, more technology and much patients is needed on all parties. Pray that the power of the Holy Spirit keeps superseeding all issues, and languages .

### Ministries
Our ministry is outreach based. We are not a chapel that exist between 4 walls, we have been commanded by the scriptures to "go out!" Our Mission Statement is found in Luke 14:23  "And the Lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled."

#### Prayer
If  you don't FAST you won't LAST, if you don't PRAY you won't STAY. Prayer is the key, and we are a praying faith family. We believe in tarry for the gift of the Holy Spirit. Not that we have to wait until it arrives, because it's already here. Nevertheless, we that it's neccessary to meet the "condition" in which we are able to receive the indwelling of th Holy Spirit. So through prayer and tarrying, we can ask God to come in and take "everything in us" thats stands in the way of us receiving this gift to be removed!

####  Elders / Seniors
We believe that our elers/seniors are jewels, and should be treated as such. As par of our "Outreach Ministry", we visit the eldery/seniors whereever they may reside. Not only visit but have service with them, including the Eucharist. It's important to remmber and honor their years of service given unto the Lord, and their faith-community. It doesn't matter what faith-community they belong to, if there is a spiritual need, we will try to fill it via the leading of the Holy Spirit! Let's NOT THROW our elderly/seniors way. See if you can SERVE them today!

#### Sabbath School
The book that we use for our Saturday School is from Union Gospel Press Publication, "Christian Life Series". They are by the quater based books. These books offer great lessons for our Christian Life. Our Saturday School Lessons offer plenty food for thought, and often very spirited classes. When is the lat time you were at Sunday/Saturday School?  Try it and see for yourself!

#### Youth
We are looking for a Praise Team Saved Volunteer Leader, and we are looking for youth to particpate as well!

#### Music
We take music to be a ministry as well. We celebrate the ways Psalms 150 says for us o do. We use modern technology for songs, we enjoy the way the saints use to do it, foot stumping and hanclapping. You might see a washboard too. We are looking for God to send someone that wants to serve God with the gift he has given them to be a musician. We wants someone that wants to join or local, rather than play or our local as a job.

#### Community Service
As part of our "Outreach Minisry", we have various bazaars: health, free clothes, free food, tracts arepase out as well. Some of the members serve as legal guarians for youth, for adults that have been ajudicated mentally incompetent to medical decisions fo themselves. We are involved in numerours projects throughout the year. We are all about being a "servant" of the Lord.

We want everyone to come and worship the Lord with us. These are the different ways you can share in the worship experience with us. Come on into God's House the "House of Prayer!"
