## Volunteer Adult Guardian
As a volunteer guardians we serve as advocates & medical decision makers for Adults, that have been adjudicated Mentally Incompetent by Probate Court. The blessing has been how my life as a volunteer guardian has been enriched by the people I have served. The longer I volunteer and the more I serve as guardian for one person, the deeper the bond becomes with that person. As you volunteer you realize that One Person and does make a difference. As guardians, we are on call 24/7 in order to be able to advocate for the adult (ward). We volunteer through and the support of the Adult Guardian Services.

### Other Content
In additional, I've also experience the same thing to a family member looking for a venue for their wedding. If the couple finds a venue for the wedding, it may come with a package deal that includes an officiant, and their officiant can not be replace with one or more of your own choosing. Often the officiant (Pastor, Clergy, Judge) might offer limit weddings plans/packages, or say they do but give you their can package @ the wedding.

To the other extreme, there are those officiants who are in the business of marrying couples. There again, they can be constricting with their plans and packages as well. They may offer you a variety of "their" plans/package which you make work for you on your day. They may be very flexible and really work with you to come up with a package/plan for your day.
However, it's still a business to them. I am gratefully for their ability to serve couples so they don't have to work with officiants described above.

As a volunteer guardian for adults that have been adjudicated mentally incompetent, and therefore unable to make any medical or legal decision for themselves. I have seen how people are treated when staff and or the facility thinks they have no one to advocate for them. I have seen the different in the same staff when they know someone is in place to advocate for them.
It's no surprise then the difference it make when clergy, Deacon, Lay Person designated to provide pastoral care enters a facility. The impact they have on the person they came to visit as well as the staff and facility. I know the difference first hand from both perspectives, as a patient and as the visitor, clergy, asst. Chaplin.
It is because of these three experiences is why the Pastoral Care Services of Life's Ripples Ministries was created.
